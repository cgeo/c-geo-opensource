I. Prerequisites

	- Android SDK 2.2 including Google APIs V8
	- Google USB Driver package to install the application on the smartphone
	- ant 1.6.0+ for building c:geo on the command line

II. Known limitations

    If the workspace directory name contains a space and leads to errors in the -dex Ant target,
    then you need to set the property "basedir" in your local.properties to the 8.3 name of the
    directory where this script is located on your disk.

III. Ant

    (only once)
    1. copy ./templates/private.properties to ./
    2. edit private.properties (see comments)
    3. copy ./templates/local.properties to ./
    4. edit local.properties (see comments)

    (every build)
    5. run in ./ one of the following commands:
            ant help
            ant clean
            ant debug
            ant release
    or use the Ant view


IV. Other (only once before your normal build)

    follow steps from above, but run
        ant debugAPI

    -- or --

    1) copy ./templates/mapsapikey.xml to ./res/values/
    2) edit ./res/values/mapsapikey.xml and insert your api-key

V. Debugging

	1. Add android:debuggable="true" in the application settings of AndroidManifest.xml
	2. Create a Debug Configuration for an Android Application
