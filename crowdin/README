INSTALLATION

- create a NEW local repo from the private github repo
- define upstream:
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo.git
- copy crowdin/credentials.template to crowdin/credentials
- edit crowdin/credentials
  -> find the API-KEY here https://crowdin.com/project/cgeo/settings#api

INFORMATION

- the scripts automatically runs: git pull (from upstream), git push, git commit
- DON'T DO ANY WORK ON THIS REPO!! It will be pushed automatically!
- this repo can be a copy (cp -a) from an existing one

if we want to automate this:
- create a cronjob to run crowdin/download every 60 mins or trigger it somehow
- create a cronjob to run crowdin/update every 60 mins or trigger it somehow

THE SCRIPTS

Run all scripts from within a repo.
Before running the script(s) switch to the planned branch. Allowed are master and release.

- update: no arguments
  -> This will upload the base language file values/strings.xml to crowdin, depending on the current branch.
     From master, it will upload to master and globals, from release to release.

- download: optional argument: pr
  -> This will download the language files from crowdin.
     If the parameter 'pr' is present, it will create/update a pull request against master or release,
     depending on the current branch, if necessary.
  -> The script checks the git status to find new languages.
