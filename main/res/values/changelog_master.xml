<h1>Developer version:</h1>

<h4>Android 11 notice:</h4>
Android 11 enforces a new way for storing data, which c:geo does not support yet. If you switch your system to Android 11, c:geo will not be able to access part of its data. This will most likely disable storing offline maps, importing/exporting data as well as backing up/restoring c:geo\'s database. Other effects may occur. We recommend to not upgrade to Android 11 for the time being.

<h4>Map:</h4>

<li>New: Map downloader for OpenStreetMap offline maps (see map selector menu and settings - map)</li>
<li>New: Open local .map files in c:geo by tapping on them</li>

</ul>

<h4>Map: Individual routes:</h4>
<ul>
