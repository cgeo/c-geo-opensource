# Publishing playstore descriptions

## Working mode

At the moment publishing of playstore descriptions is done manually. As the source texts for these app descriptions should not change frequently, the manual process should be sufficient.
This table shall therefore provide an overview about the dates, where description texts for individual languages have been
taken from Github and published on Google Play.

From time to time it needs to be manually checked whether more recent changes to the translation files are existsing on the
repository, which then need to be published on Google Play and this table being updated afterwards.
